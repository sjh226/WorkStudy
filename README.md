# WorkStudy
<br><br>
### Introduction
L48 has been collecting field technician actions data via Enbase for the last 2 years.
However, a clear picture of workforce activities and time spent in the field has
not yet been collated. This study will review available data streams to answer a
few key questions:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*What are we doing?*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*What work is occurring outside the dispatch system?*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*What should we be doing?*
Building on the last question above, field work will be divided into three categories:  
<span style='color:red'>Red</span>: activity that should not be occurring in the field. These tasks either do not add value or are already automated.
<span style='color:yellow'>Yellow</span>: activity that adds marginal value or could be automated soon with additional technology.
<span style='color:green'>Green</span>: activity that cannot be automated, and should therefore be completed consistently and efficiently. This work will require training, Standard Operating Procedures, and checklists for L48 to be a High Reliability Organization. A separate effort led by Kim Krieger will tackle these challenges.

### Scope
The scope of this study will span the last 6 months to ensure reporting consistency and data quality. The tools built for this study will also be modified for continuous use point forward. The focus will be on BP field technicians.  
Following are a few points to investigate to determine areas of optimization:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Identify types of activity performed – *what are we doing?*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structured reports such as Surface Failures, tank gauges, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unstructured reports such as Work Management entries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Field time spent performing each activity – *what are we doing?*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary: Risk level of activity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By well/cluster of wells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time spent vs. ARROW dispatch assignments – *what work is being done outside the system?*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time spent vs. value of task being performed – *what should we be doing?*
